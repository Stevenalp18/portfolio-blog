          Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
          <br />
          <br />
           My name is Steven Perez, I am a Web Developer. I have been creating
          Web Applications since 2022. I started with simple projects, small
          forms with just HTML & CSS. Now I am building real applications,
          larger projects, personal and for clients, filled with API's, SEO,
          Responsivess, and a multitude of functions.
          <br />
          <br />
           It all started with a dream and wanting to aspire for something
          fulfilling and worthwhile! I started looking around, I was not sure
          what I wanted to do. Until eventually, I stumbled back upon an old
          hobby, coding!
          <br />
          <br />
           It was a little bit of Robot-C, a variation of the C language, many
          years ago in school! We used to build robots and program them to work
          autonomously and with a controller. I loved it then but due to a few
          financial hardships I could not continue with my further education at
          the time! I ended up working a few jobs afterwards and currently am a
          Territory Manager at a Paint Company which certainly has helped me
          thrive and has allowed me to take more time to study more seriously!
          <br />
          <br />
           I started to teach myself using Free Code Camp and learned a ton of
          basics but still had a few doubts. After countless of tutorials and
          many people telling you to follow their path and then others telling
          you not to, I ended up becoming overwhelmed and stuck. I knew there
          had to be something else, I already had HTML & CSS experience and some
          Javascript at that point. I ended up joining an affordable coding
          bootcamp, I did their Fundamentals and Full Stack Development course.
          That was certainly a catalyst in my development journey initially full
          of doubt.
          <br />
          <br />
           Fast Forward... I started to work on my projects and starting jumping
          into the documentation of different technologies, API's, etc. Like
          this one, I am using Astro for this portfolio/blog hybrid. It allows
          me to do both while serving little to no Javascript unless specified
          via partial hydration.
