          Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
          <br />
          <br />
           My name is Steven Perez, I am a Web Developer. I have been creating
          Web Applications since 2022. I started with simple projects, small
          forms with just HTML & CSS. Now I am building real applications,
          larger projects, personal and for clients, filled with API's, SEO,
          Responsivess, and a multitude of functions.
          <br />
          <br />
           It started with a dream, an old hobby, and after working many odd
          jobs, I knew I wanted a change for the better. I started to self teach
          with FreeCodeCamp but still had small doubts. I joined a small
          affordable coding bootcamp, Nucamp, and gained a lot of information to
          fill the knowledge gaps.
          <br />
          <br />
           Fast Forward... I am now building my own web applications with API's,
          React, Astro, Tailwind, many new technologies. I jumped into the deep
          end and learn by doing and taking action now! I am using Astro for
          this portfolio/blog hybrid. It allows me to do both while serving
          little to no Javascript to the client side unless specified via
          partial hydration. I also create websites professionally when I find a
          client who needs a website! I work my full time job as a Territory
          Manager at a large Paint Company and have become more serious about
          converting my passion until a full fledge career!
          <br />
          <br />
           This is just a scratch on the surface about myself, I will release my
          full story on one of the blog articles. Anyway, check out a few of my
          projects that I have created in the past, below. Also I will below my
          links directly below this.
